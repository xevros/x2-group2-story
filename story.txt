Once upon a time there was a programmer named Noodle. Noodle lived in 
 the woods with no internet connection, so he could only program on 
 local directories.
This made Noodle sad, because he wasn't able to collaborate with a team on a shared repository.
Then Noodle went to Epic's campus and his dreams of a shared repository were reborn in Phoenix.

Beyond Phoenix, Noodle discovered a magical land at Epic. There was a merry-go-round, 2 slides, caves, and a waterfall. There were so many wonders he didn't have time to see them all and was looking for a good place to go rest.

Noodle stumbled upon the tucked away cozy cabins in the grass level of deep space. He nestled into one of the soft couches reserved for our upmost important guests. The fall decor, dim lighting, and wisconsin evening ambiance helped him fall into a restful slumber. 

Little did anyone know, this would be the last time Noodle would has a peaceful sleep again... To be continued.
